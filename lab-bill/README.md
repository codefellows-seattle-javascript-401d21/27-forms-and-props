This project allows the user to input a subreddit and a number of requests, and the browser will propogate the top requests from the reddit API to the user. 

An example subreddit is 'dota2'.
An example query size is 10. 
In this example the API will make a GET request to reddit.com/r/dota2 and limit the number of results to 10.

The form will not allow you to request over 100 responses.
